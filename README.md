# Spaceman

Spaceman is a variant to the classic game, Hangman. The rules are the same.
A random word will be secretly chosen and it is your job to try and figure it out.
You will be shown a series of '_', each indicates a concealed letter in the hidden word.
You can guess either a single letter or the whole word.
- If you guess a single letter, all instances of that letter in the hidden word will be revealed.
- If you correctly guess the hidden word, the hidden word will be revealed.
You win if the whole word gets revealed.
Conversely, you lose if you make 7 incorrect guesses.
